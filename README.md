Exploratory data analysis (EDA) investigating the impact of socio-economic status on number of firearms in states

Gun Data

This data is from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). During the purchase of a firearm, gun sellers use the NICS to ensure buyers are eligible to purchase guns. The data ranges from 1997 to 2017. It contains data for each month of each year, by state, with the columns breaking down the gun checks into permit checks, permit rechecks, type of gun sold (hangun, long_gun, other), and detail of sale (rentals, prepawn, returned, etc). There is also a 'total' column for each row. It should be noted that the data does not directly correlate to the number of guns purchased, but can give a general overview of the demand for guns in a state. Gun checks do not have a one-to-one connection to number of guns sold in a state.

Census Data

This data is U.S. census data from 2016. The data includes numerous variables, some of which include ranges of time periods. The columns include population estimates, totals and broken into groups separated by age, ethnicity, and gender. Additionally, data about income, employment, housing, education, and businesses. There is one row for each of the fifty states. We will pay particular attention to the poverty percentage in order to address our key questions to analyze the relationship between firearm checks and socio-economic status. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the poverty threshold is calculated on a yearly basis and takes into consideration age, the size of the household, and number of children. The poverty threshold is the same for all states.

Key Questions

How does poverty correlate to the number of firearm checks in a state?
What economic commonalities do states with higher levels of firearm checks share?
In order to answer these questions, I will be focusing on the income and employment census data. Because the census data is from 2016, and the data covers a range from 2011-2015, I will be focusing on that time range from the gun data.
